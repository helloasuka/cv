      With a background in Informatics Engineering and a Post-graduation in
      Usability and HCI, Carla Nave worked in the industry for a couple of years
      before going back to academia, where she is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in
      Digital Media. Her thesis is focused on the design of a tool for affective
      self-report, and her main interests include HCI methods, Affective
      Computing, and Positive Computing. Apart from research, she also likes to
      organize events (<a href="https://digitalmedia.summerinstitute.pt/"
        >Digital Media Summer Institute 2020</a
      >, <a href="http://rebootfest.pt/">Reboot festival</a>, Digital Media
      meetups) and develop web apps (HTML, CSS, Javascript, VUE.js, Vuetify).
