      With a background in Informatics Engineering and a Post-graduation in
      Usability and HCI, Carla Nave worked in the industry for a couple of years
      before going back to academia, where she is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in
      Digital Media. Her thesis is focused on the design of a tool for affective
      self-report, and her main interests include HCI methods, Affective
      Computing, and Positive Computing. Besides research, she also does web
      development. Currently, she is exploring the JAMstack (JAM - JavaScript,
      APIs, and Markup) to build fast websites.
